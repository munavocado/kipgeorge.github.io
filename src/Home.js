      <h2>Welcome to my website.</h2>

      <p>
        I'm Kip George, a digital artist studying at DigiPen: Institute of
        Technology for my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Art and Animation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creating backgrounds and making characters act goofy are my jam! I'm
        most interested in 2D illustration and animation, and I'm very excited
        to learn 3D.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently looking for summer internship opportunities!
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not hunched over my homework, I enjoy building with Legos and
        making 1&frasl;12 scale furnished doll interiors.
